## 📖 About the Project

I always thought coding was too hard for me. I spent over a year of college unsure and unproductive — until I realized others my age were already learning and building real things.

So I decided to start.

With the help of YouTube tutorials and ChatGPT, I learned the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **responsive web design**. After weeks of practice and effort, I built this project — a clean, mobile-friendly product landing page.

It may be simple, but to me, it's a symbol of starting something I once believed I couldn’t do.
